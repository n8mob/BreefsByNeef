=========================

A simple content-management system for holding the content of _Breefs by Neef_, by F. Nephi Grigg

I think I included a license file stating that the code is available under the terms of the MIT license.
But the content of the book is Copyright Â©1985 by F. Nephi Grigg, all rights reserved.

But since the text is not included in the repository, it shouldn't matter.
